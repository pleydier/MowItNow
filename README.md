# MowItNow
Academic project for Introduction to Scala class.

In collaboration with:
  - [Paul Leydier](https://github.com/pleydier?tab=repositories)
  - [Wenceslas Sanchez](https://github.com/Orlogskapten?tab=repositories)

The project goal is to automate a mower, in which we put a list of instructions (left, right, go forward) according to an initial localisation into a given area.

If you want more precision about that project, look at the [file](MowItNow%20projet%20scala%202019%202020.pdf).
